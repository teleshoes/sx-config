#  NAME   DELAY_INTERVAL   TIMEOUT_INTERVAL   COMMAND
#
#   DELAY_INTERVAL:   e.g: 5min  after command exits, re-run after 5min
#                          0     never re-run command, exit daemon after command
#   TIMEOUT_INTERVAL: e.g: 5min  kill command after it has been running for 5min

#     if DELAY_INTERVAL is 30s and TIMEOUT_INTERVAL is 30s,
#       COMMAND will be run at least once a minute, and at most twice a minute
#     intervals are integers followed by a unit (ms, s, m, min, h, d)
